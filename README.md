# ü¶â Hello, I am Owlet!

## üëã Project Description

This is the cross-platform application, built with Electron, uses the [Nightscout API](https://nightscout.github.io/). The aim is to provide a lightweight interface for your T1D measurement visualization (blood sugar levels).
The widget will stay on top of your screen, so you don't need to keep your Nightscout site in the browser opened to see your/your relative's or kid's measurements in real-time anymore.
I was inspired by the [mlukasek/M5_NightscoutMon](https://github.com/mlukasek/M5_NightscoutMon) solution, built on [M5 Stack's](https://m5stack.com/) hardware platform.

### Nightscout API Settings

- **NIGHTSCOUT URL** - is the address of your nightscout (e.g. https://some-cgm.fly.dev) 
- **NIGHTSCOUT TOKEN** - the access token you've created on the previous steps
- **NIGHTSCOUT REQUEST INTERVAL (SEC.)** - the interval of the getting information from the Nightscout site to display in the widget (60 seconds will be OK)

### Widget preferences
- **AGE LIMIT (MIN.)** - the timeout of data requesting interval, after that interval widget will change their appearance on "frozen" state. Usually it means that reader is offline or detached from the sensor, or the smartphone's battery is drained out
